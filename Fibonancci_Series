# Task is to print fibonacci series in python using recurssion method#

#fibonacciseries is a series where next num is a sum of previous two num in a series#

#and we can find this series by using this formula fib(n-1)=fib(n-2)#

num=int(input("Enter a num :"))

print("below is a fibonacci series...")
def fib(n):
    if n==0:
        return 0
    elif  n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
for i in range (0,num):   
        print(fib(i))
